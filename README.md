# TVshows API Project
(Originally I went with Marvel's API, but switched to this free TVshows API)
This is a short project design to better undestand the React fundamentals. 
## Requirements
- Must use React
- Must use React Router and have at least 3 routes
- Apply styling
- Call an API
- Store information from the API call into global state
- (Optional) Use Context API for global state
    - At least one child component must access the global state, and one that update the global state
